This handcrafted repo contains my Emacs Lisp code tying together a selection of more than one hundred of the finest packages ever written for Emacs, all working in harmony with one another.

When I was starting off with GNU Emacs, other people's customizations were deeply helpful for me as a starting point; some of those customizations still find a home in my Emacs instance today. In the spirit of free software, I hope that I can pass on the good will.

## Tips

Everything is very organized in the `enzuru` folder by feature, mode, preference, setup, operating system, and theme. While this repo should work immediately for you on a `git pull`, it's obviously a very personalized setup and many things won't appeal to you. If I were you, I would first take a look at my `init.el` and then pick a topical elisp file from there.

The foundation of my package management strategy is [straight.el](https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el) and [use-package](https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el).

Happy hacking!
