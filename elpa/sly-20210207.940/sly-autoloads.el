Have SLY load and use extension modules CONTRIBS.
CONTRIBS defaults to `sly-contribs' and is a list (LIB1 LIB2...)
symbols of `provide'd and `require'd Elisp libraries.

If CONTRIBS is nil, `sly-contribs' is *not* affected, otherwise
it is set to CONTRIBS.

However, after `require'ing LIB1, LIB2 ..., this command invokes
additional initialization steps associated with each element
LIB1, LIB2, which can theoretically be reverted by
`sly-disable-contrib.'

Notably, one of the extra initialization steps is affecting the
value of `sly-required-modules' (which see) thus affecting the
libraries loaded in the Slynk servers.

If SLY is currently connected to a Slynk and a contrib in
CONTRIBS has never been loaded, that Slynk is told to load the
associated Slynk extension module.

To ensure that a particular contrib is loaded, use
`sly-enable-contrib' instead.

(autoload 'sly "sly" "\
Start a Lisp implementation and connect to it.

  COMMAND designates a the Lisp implementation to start as an
\"inferior\" process to the Emacs process. It is either a
pathname string pathname to a lisp executable, a list (EXECUTABLE
ARGS...), or a symbol indexing
`sly-lisp-implementations'. CODING-SYSTEM is a symbol overriding
`sly-net-coding-system'.

Interactively, both COMMAND and CODING-SYSTEM are nil and the
prefix argument controls the precise behaviour:

- With no prefix arg, try to automatically find a Lisp.  First
  consult `sly-command-switch-to-existing-lisp' and analyse open
  connections to maybe switch to one of those.  If a new lisp is
  to be created, first lookup `sly-lisp-implementations', using
  `sly-default-lisp' as a default strategy.  Then try
  `inferior-lisp-program' if it looks like it points to a valid
  lisp.  Failing that, guess the location of a lisp
  implementation.

- With a positive prefix arg (one C-u), prompt for a command
  string that starts a Lisp implementation.

- With a negative prefix arg (M-- M-x sly, for example) prompt
  for a symbol indexing one of the entries in
  `sly-lisp-implementations'
